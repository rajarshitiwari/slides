## Slide 1: Linear Algebra
- Vector independence
- Span and dimension
- Equation: $a \mathbf{v}_1 + b \mathbf{v}_2 = 0$

$$
\sqrt{\pi} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx
$$

$$
\sqrt{\pi} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx
$$

## Slide 2: Quantum Mechanics
Hilbert space grows as $2^n$ with number of qubits $n$.

---

## Slide 3: Greek Letters
$\alpha x^2 + \beta y^2 = \gamma z^2$

---

## Slide 4: Code Highlighting

```python
def f(x):
    return x**2 + 1
